# Housing Data Analysis
## Overview
### This repository contains Python code for analyzing a housing dataset. The analysis includes data cleaning, univariate analysis, multivariate analysis, and visualizations to understand the various factors influencing house prices. The dataset used for this analysis is loaded from a CSV file ('Housing_data.csv').

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
### Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
pandas
numpy
seaborn
matplotlib

# Analysis Steps
1. Data Loading and Inspection
The initial steps involve loading the dataset and inspecting its structure and data types.

2. Handling Missing Values
Missing values in the 'Electrical' and 'GarageYrBlt' columns are addressed.

3. Univariate Analysis
Univariate analysis is performed for both numerical and categorical features. Summary statistics, histograms, box plots, and density plots are created.

4. Multivariate Analysis
Multivariate analysis explores relationships between multiple variables. Scatter plots, correlation matrices, regression analysis, and other visualizations are used.

5. Analysis of Data with Plots
Various types of plots, including box plots, scatter plots, violin plots, bubble plots, histograms, bar plots, and kernel density estimation (KDE) plots, are used to analyze the data.

# Conclusion
The analysis provides insights into the housing dataset, identifying key factors affecting house prices. Further exploration and modeling can be performed based on the observations made during the analysis.
